# Mastering CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool for creating complex, responsive layouts with CSS. It allows you to create two-dimensional layouts for your web pages.

## Basic Grid Container

To create a grid container, you simply use `display: grid` on an element:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a 3-column grid with 2 rows. The first row is 100px tall, the second is 200px tall, and there's a 20px gap between all cells.

## Grid Template Areas

One of the most powerful features of CSS Grid is grid template areas:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header header"
    "sidebar content ads"
    "footer footer footer";
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.sidebar { grid-area: sidebar; }
.content { grid-area: content; }
.ads { grid-area: ads; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }
```

This creates a common layout with a header, footer, main content, and two sidebars.

## Responsive Grids

CSS Grid makes it easy to create responsive layouts without media queries (though you can use them together):

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a responsive grid where each column is at least 250px wide, and they automatically fill the available space.

## Grid Auto Flow

You can control how items flow into the grid:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
  grid-auto-flow: dense;
}
```

With `grid-auto-flow: dense`, grid items will fill in any available spaces, even if they're not in the source order.

## Conclusion

CSS Grid is an incredibly powerful layout tool that has changed how we design for the web. With its two-dimensional approach, you can create complex layouts that were difficult or impossible with previous methods.

Try combining Grid with Flexbox (using Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for UI components) for the most flexibility!
